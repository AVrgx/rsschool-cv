## About Me

I started learning programming as a hobby. It always seemed like something very complicated. I tried JavaRush to begin with, then it seemed complicated to me, but it was already understandable. I took the Python generation course on Stepik, the course was very easy, simple mathematics. I decided that it was time to decide what I wanted to do in the future. Now Iâ€™ve taken up Javascript, mostly self-education. I entered RS school in the hope of putting my knowledge together, brushing up on something, learning something, and working on various projects.
